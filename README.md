# Statistical-Machine-Learning-Basics
This repository contains implementation of classifiers and linear regression methods from scratch. These codes were written for Statistical Machine Learning class (STAT 760) offered by Prof. Raul Rojas in Spring 2019. [Raul rojas](http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-ki/rojas_home/pmwiki/pmwiki.phpXn=Main.HomePage). The main focus is on the mathematical and theoretical treatments of various concepts.

## Classifiers and Regression:
- Fisher Discriminant
- Perceptron learning
- Neural Networks
- Regularized Neural Network and Batch normalization
- KNN
- Linear regression based on ordinary least squares (OLS)
- Subset selection method for linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Ridge regression
- Lasso regression
